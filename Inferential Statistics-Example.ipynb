    "### Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling distributions of many statistics of interest look similarly symmetric and bell-shaped. An important mathematical result, the Central Limit Theorem, specifies the conditions for which a statistic's sampling distribution will approximately follow a normal distribution. The **Central Limit Theorem** (CLT) states that if random samples of size  are drawn from a large population and  is large enough, then the sampling distribution of the sample mean will follow approximately a normal distribution. The CLT also applies to proportions since a proportion can be expressed as the mean of zeros and ones.\n",

    "A hypothesis test is a method for evaluating a claim, or hypothesis, about a population parameter by examining the statistical evidence against the claim based on a sample. The conclusion of a hypothesis test is a decision that the observed data either indicate the claim is plausible or support an alternative explanation. The following steps outline the general process of conducting a hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  State null and alternative hypotheses about parameters. **The null hypothesis**,*H<sub>0</sub>* , is typically the by-chance or no-effect explanation, and the **alternative hypothesis**, *H<sub>a</sub>* , is typically the explanation of an effect, or difference.\n",
    "2.  Calculate a statistic of interest from the sample data that is used to evaluate the null hypothesis.\n",
    "3.  Determine the p-value, or likelihood, of obtaining a statistic at least as extreme as the observed statistic when the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "4.  Draw a conclusion about the null hypothesis based on the statistical evidence provided by the p-value.\n"

The decision is to reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than or equal to **ùõÇ**, and fail to reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is greater than **ùõÇ**.\n",

Ex: Suppose the conclusion from a hypothesis test is that the data support a population mean commute time of 25 minutes. If the mean commute time of the population is actually about 25 minutes, then a correct decision is made. But, if the population mean commute time is actually 40 minutes, then an incorrect decision is made.\n",
